Java Iterator Interface
-----------------------
The Iterator Interface of the Java Collections Framework allows us to access elements of a collection.It has a subinterface ListIterator.

All the Java Collections include an iterator() method. This method returns an instance of iterator used to iterator used to iterate over elements of collections.

Methods of iterator
-------------------

iterator provides 4 methods that can be used to perform various operations  on element of collections.

hasNext() --->returns True if there exists an element in the Collection
next()		----->returns the next element of the collection
remove()	----->removes the last element returned by the next()
forEachRemaning   ----->performs the specified action for each reamaning element of the collection. inside constructor of forEachRemaning() we need to pass the functional interface.


List iterator
-------------
ListIterator interface of the Java Collections framework provides the functionality to access elements of a list.

It is bidirectional .This means it allows us to iterate the elements of a list in both the direction.

it extends Iterator Interface.

Methods of ListIterator()
--------------------------
hasNext()
next()
nextIndex()  	returns the index of the element that next() method will return
previous()
previousIndex()
remove()
set()     --->replaces the element returned by either next() or previous()
