List
----
represents ordered collection of objects and there may be duplicate elements also 


list interface inherits collection interface

methods 
--------
add(int index,E e);           ---->adding at proper index

addAll(int index,Collection<E> e)\

remove (int index)

get(int index)

set(int index,E e)           ----->it will change that place only while add method will replace and make a free space.

sublist(int from,int to)        ---->to get elements from index to index

indexof(object o)                ----->Give the index of the character

lastindexof(object o)                ----->This iterator will work in both directions.

listiterator()			------>this iterator will work in both directions.

listiterator(int index)

interface set extends  collections. it has same methods as same as collections.

Queue Interface
---------------
This supports FIFO mechanism  i.e first in and first out.

add(E e)    -->it will not ask you where to add it will add the object in last of the array

poll()      --->it will not ask it will remove the first element if founf empty return null

remove() throws NoSuchElement Exception

This is same as poll() but the diffence is if it is queue is empty them throught the excepion. i.e NoSuchElementException

peek()     ----> if i want to know what is the next ekement coming out from the Queue then we will use this if empty returns null().

element() thows NoSuchElementException

this is same as peek method but throws exception when their is no next element present.
